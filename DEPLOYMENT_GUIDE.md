# 🎮 Chess Platform - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Your Chess Game is Ready to Deploy!

I've set up everything for your Chess Platform deployment. Follow these simple steps to get your chess game live on the web.

## 📋 One-Time Setup (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/devslayr/Essentials-of-IT-Ethics---Assignment3/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Monitor Deployment
1. **Check the deployment progress:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/devslayr/Essentials-of-IT-Ethics---Assignment3/actions
   - Look for the workflow: "Deploy Chess Platform to GitHub Pages"
   - Wait for the green checkmark ✅

### Step 3: Play Chess Online!
Once deployment completes (usually 2-5 minutes), your chess game will be live at:

**🎯 Your Chess Game URL:**
**https://devslayr.github.io/Essentials-of-IT-Ethics---Assignment3/**

## 🎮 What You'll Experience

### Navigation Flow:

2. **Game Interface** → Click "Home" → **Back to Homepage**

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Deployment:
- ✅ Every time you push code to `main` branch
- ✅ GitHub Actions automatically builds your chess game
- ✅ Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Your game updates automatically!

### What Was Set Up:
1. **package.json** - Added deployment scripts and gh-pages dependency
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automated build and deployment
3. **Build Configuration** - Optimized for web deployment

## 🎯 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Wait for green checkmark** in the Actions tab
2. **Visit your chess game URL**
3. **Test the homepage** - should show chess-themed interface
4. **Click "Start Playing"** - should navigate to chess board
5. **Make a chess move** - drag a piece to test functionality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you see a 404 error:
- Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Wait a few more minutes for deployment to complete

### If the workflow fails:
- Check the Actions tab for error details
- Usually resolves by pushing another commit

### If the game doesn't work:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all files were committed and pushed

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ The Actions workflow shows green checkmarks
- ✅ Your URL shows the chess homepage (not a 404)
- ✅ The "Start Playing" button navigates to the chess game
